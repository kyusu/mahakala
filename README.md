## Purpose
[Mahakala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahakala) is just a small command-line application which is able to query a NovaTimeÂ© time tracking system for your state (present/absent).

## Motivation
My current employer is using a time tracking system. And I, not being used to a punch clock, keep forgetting to "punch in" in the morning or after the lunch break which means I'm essentially working for free then. So I was looking for way to see my time tracking state in the menu bar of my mac. *BitBar* ~~is~~ was an excellent way of adding information to your menu bar, but how to get the information from our NovaTimeÂ© installation?

In addition to the practical reason mentioned above, I was also looking for an excuse to try out [monad transformers](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/monad-transformers-javascript-vladimÃ­r-gorej) or to be more precise [ReaderT](https://evilsoft.github.io/crocks/docs/crocks/ReaderT.html) as way to improve the testability of effectful code.

## Usage

In our home directory you have to create a file called `.mahakala`. The content of the file should be JSON of the following schema:
```
{"userName": "1234", "password": "secret", "url": "http://yourLocalNovaTimeInstallation/cgi-bin/htm_term.cgi"}
```
where `userName` is the account name/number which you normally use to sign in. `password` does not need any explanation and `url` should point to your local NovaTimeÂ© installation.

After that you can use run mahakala and it should output the following:

* ðŸ’“ â€“ The system considers you being present
* ðŸ’” â€“ The system considers you being absent
* ðŸ’¥ - Mahakala was not able to fetch the state during error, e.g. no network connection
